Making a node js app
this application only sends json requests
 - one index page for documentation and rest is json data

1st step - create folder >
    - npm init (to initialize)
    - npm install express --save 
    - git ignore is just a file where we will add node modules (not needed by git)
    - create server.js

2.  server.js 
    const express = require('express')
    const app  = express ()
    - serve a file to test if server is working
    - 
    -add event listener for '/' (app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
        response.sendFile('__dirname/index.html')
        __dirname represents the directory
        }))

3.  add listener to server for incomming requests and tell what to do 
4. to turn on node , write node server.js to turn it on 
----------------------------------------
after changes , we need to restart node crtl+c and node server.js
---
now that our code is running, we will add a query to get a particular rapper name

use /:name for event listener
request.params.name will get the name
then response.json or sendFile with object['name']

-----
- login to heroku 'heroku login -i' 
- heroku create xxx name of api 

now to let heroku know which server to start, we need a procfile
    a procfile is just text eg' web: node server.js'
    command -  echo 'web: node server.js' > procfile

if we push our code to heroku, heroku needs to set their own ports
so we will add process.env.PORT || PORT (to backup to hardcoded port)
